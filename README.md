  This project introduces us to Express.js which is used to help us build a website with back-end functionality. The starter code provides us with the front-end. Express is used to build the server side which is then deployed on Heroku.

  ## Installation

  The livesite on Heroku does not require that you download anything. But if you want test out the code for yourself in vscode or any other coding program, note that this is a Node.js application. It is recommended that the user have Node.js v16 (up to v18) downloaded on their pc for the app to run correctly. After that, you should download these two packages from NPM, Express and Nodemon. Just type in these following commands into the terminal, 'npm i express' and 'npm i nodemon' (do not include the quotes). Nodemon allows you to run the server while freely editing the code. The server will automatically reset after your change is made. To utilize nodemon, just type into the terminal 'npx nodemon server'. If you want to safely close out of the  server, just press ctrl c on your keyboard."


  ## Usage

  When you enter the site, just press on the "Get Started" button, and it should bring you to a page where you can record your notes. Once on the notes page, you can click on the text fields in the right column to start recording your notes. After finishing, you can save these notes by pressing the save button that will appear on the top right near the plus (add notes) button. You will see your note title saved to the left column. When you click on it, you will be able to read the full details of your note. The notes will stay on the page even after you refresh it. If you want to delete a note, you can press on the red trashcan button right next to it.
